Welcome to the **The GitHub Reflog** — the weekly chronicle of
remarkable GitHub repos and community activity. For previous
editions, check out
`The Reflog Archive <https://github.com/kennethreitz/github-reflog>`_.

Thanks to the awesome work of Alexander Marshalov, the Reflog
archive is now being
`translated into Russian <https://github.com/Amper/github-reflog>`_!

Featured Repo of the Week
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`yostudios/Spritemapper <https://github.com/yostudios/Spritemapper>`_

    Spritemapper is a command-line application that generates CSS
    sprites from your existing CSS files. It utilizes advanced
    techniques, like simulated annealing, to merge the referenced PNG
    images into one and generate a new CSS file utilizing the new
    sprite map.

    It also contains its own PNG and CSS parser. All you need is a
    Python interpreter. If you've ever had to debug a PIL installation,
    you know how important this is.


Awesome Repo of the Week
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`jstrait/beats <https://github.com/jstrait/beats>`_

    This project is nothing short of amazing.

    BEATS is a command-line audio sequencer, written in Ruby.

    Songs are programmed in YAML. The input files define instruments
    (samples), bar sequences, and the full song structure. The whole
    song can then be exported to LPCM WAV for later enjoyment /
    mixing.
